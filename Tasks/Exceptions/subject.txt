1. Create exceptions: My ArraySizeException (incorrect
array size), and My Array Data Exception (there is something wrong in the array cell);
2. Write a method whose input is a two-dimensional string array (String[][]) with a size of 4Ã—4). When submitting an array of a different size, an exception must be thrown
MyArraySizeException.
3. Next, the method should go through all the elements of the array, convert to int and sum. If the conversion failed in some element of the array (for example, in
the cell contains a symbol or text instead of a number), the My Array Data Exception exception should be thrown with details in which cell the incorrect data lies. The calculation of data for this matrix is terminated.
4. In the main() method, you need to call the received method, handle possible exceptions MySizeArrayException and MyArrayDataException and output the calculation result.
