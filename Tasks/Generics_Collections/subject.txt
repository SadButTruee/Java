1. Write a method that swaps two array elements (the array can be of any reference type).
2. Write a method that converts an array to an ArrayList.
3. Task:
a. Classes Fruit -> Apple, Orange are given.
b. Class Box, in which you can put fruits. Boxes are conventionally sorted by type of fruit, so you can't put both apples and oranges in one box.
c. An ArrayList can be used to store fruit inside the box.
d. Write a getWeight() method that calculates the weight of the box. Set the weight of one fruit and their number: the weight of an apple is 1.0f, an orange is 1.5f (units of measurement are not important).
e. Inside the Box class, write a Compare method that allows you to compare the current box with the one that will be served in Compare as a parameter. True if their masses are equal, False otherwise. You can compare boxes with apples and oranges.
f. Write a method that allows you to pour fruit from the current box into another. Remember about sorting fruits: you can not pour apples into a box with oranges. Accordingly, there is no fruit left in the current box, and objects that were in the first one are thrown into the other. g.
Do not forget about the method of adding fruit to the box.
