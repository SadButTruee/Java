1 The database must be able to store information about customers (id, name)
and products (id, name, cost);

2 Each buyer has his own set of purchased goods, one purchase of one product is
a separate entry in the table (no need to group);

3 Write a test console application (just Scanner and System.out.println()), which
will allow you to execute the commands:
   //showProductsByPerson buyer's name - see which products the customer bought;
   //findPersonsByProductTitle product name - which customers bought a certain product;
   //removePerson(removeProduct) element name - to provide an opportunity to remove
         goods/buyers from the database,
   //buy buyer's name of the product name - to organize the possibility of â€œbuying goods".
