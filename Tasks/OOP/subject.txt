1. Create three classes of Man, Cat, Robot, which are not inherited from one class. These classes should be able to run and jump, all with the output of information about the action to the console.
2. Create two classes: a treadmill and a wall, when passing through which participants must perform the appropriate actions (run or jump), the result of the execution is printed into the console (successfully ran, could not run, etc.). Obstacles have a length (for the track) or height (for the wall), and participants have restrictions on running and jumpingI.
3. Create two arrays: with participants and obstacles, and force all participants to pass this set of obstacles. If the participant could not pass one of the obstacles, then he does not go further down the list of obstacles.
